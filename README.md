# todomvc
Just a django project to hold some todomvc examples

`angular` app adds the _angularjs_ example from todomvc.
`csrf` has been added (with `ng-cookies`). Also I added `verbatim` in the templates to make the template engines (angular & django) work...

Example is working but... Don't have a look at the console, not sure why yet, but it complains a lot... Usshh !!
